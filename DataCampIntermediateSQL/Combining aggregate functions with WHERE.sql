/* Combining aggregate functions with WHERE
When combining aggregate functions with WHERE, you get a powerful tool that allows you to get more granular with your insights, for example, to get the total budget of movies made from the year 2010 onwards.

This combination is useful when you only want to summarize a subset of your data. In your film-industry role, as an example, you may like to summarize each certification category to compare how they each perform or if one certification has a higher average budget than another.

Let's see what insights you can gain about the financials in the dataset.
