/* Using BETWEEN
Let's use BETWEEN with AND on the films database to get the title and release_year of all Spanish-language films released between 
1990 and 2000 (inclusive) with budgets over $100 million.

We have broken the problem into smaller steps so that you can build the query as you go along!

Instructions 
1- Select the title and release_year of all films released between 1990 and 2000 (inclusive) using BETWEEN.
2- Build on your previous query to select only films with a budget over $100 million.
3- Now, restrict the query to only return Spanish-language films.
4- Finally, amend the query to include all Spanish-language or French-language films with the same criteria.
