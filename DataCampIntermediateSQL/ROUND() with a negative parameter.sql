/* ROUND() with a negative parameter
A useful thing you can do with ROUND() is have a negative number as the decimal place parameter. This can come in handy if your manager 
only needs to know the average number of facebook_likes to the hundreds since granularity below one hundred likes won't impact decision 
making.

Social media plays a significant role in determining success. If a movie trailer is posted and barely gets any likes, the movie itself 
may not be successful. Remember how 2020's "Sonic the Hedgehog" movie got a revamp after the public saw the trailer?

Let's apply this to other parts of the dataset and see what the benchmark is for movie budgets so, in the future, it's clear whether 
the film is above or below budget.
