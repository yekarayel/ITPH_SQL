/* Order of execution
SQL code is processed differently than other programming languages in that you need to let the processor know where to pull the data from before making selections.

It's essential to know your code's order of execution compared to the order it is written in to understand what results you'll get from your query and how to fix any errors that may come up.

Instructions

Drag the SQL keywords into the order that they will be executed in (not the written order) from first (top) to last (bottom). */
