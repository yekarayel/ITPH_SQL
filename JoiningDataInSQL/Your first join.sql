/* Your first join
Throughout this course, you'll be working with the countries database, which contains information about the most populous world cities in the world, along with country-level economic, population, and geographic data. The database also contains information on languages spoken in each country.

You can see the different tables in this database to get a sense of what they contain by clicking on the corresponding tabs. Click through them and familiarize yourself with the fields that seem to be shared across tables before you continue with the course.

In this exercise, you'll use the cities and countries tables to build your first inner join. You'll start off by selecting all columns in step 1, performing your join in step 2, and then refining your join to choose specific columns in step 3.
