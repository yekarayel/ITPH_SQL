/* This is a LEFT JOIN, right?
Nice work getting to grips with the structure of joins! In this exercise, you'll explore the differences between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN. 
This will help you decide which type of join to use.

As before, you will be using the cities and countries tables.

You'll begin with an INNER JOIN with the cities table (left) and countries table (right). This helps if you are interested only 
in records where a country is present in both tables.

You'll then change to a LEFT JOIN. This helps if you're interested in returning all countries in the cities table, whether or not 
they have a match in the countries table.
