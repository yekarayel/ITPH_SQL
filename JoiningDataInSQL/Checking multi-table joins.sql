/* Checking multi-table joins
Have a look at the results for Albania from the previous query below. You can see that the 2015 fertility_rate has been paired 
with 2010 unemployment_rate, and vice versa.

name	    year	  fertility_rate	  unemployment_rate
Albania	  2015	  1.663	            17.1
Albania	  2010	  1.663	            14
Albania	  2015	  1.793	            17.1
Albania	  2010	  1.793	            14

Instead of four records, the query should return two: one for each year. The last join was performed on c.code = e.code, without also 
joining on year. Your task in this exercise is to fix your query by explicitly stating that both the country code and year should match!

Instructions

* Modify your query so that you are joining to economies on year as well as code. */

SELECT name, e.year, fertility_rate, unemployment_rate
FROM countries AS c
INNER JOIN populations AS p
ON c.code = p.country_code
INNER JOIN economies AS e
ON c.code = e.code
-- Add an additional joining condition such that you are also joining on year
	AND p.year = e.year;
