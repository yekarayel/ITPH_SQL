/*  You've got it, EXCEPT...
Just as you were able to leverage INTERSECT to find the names of cities with the same names as countries, you can also do the reverse, 
using EXCEPT.

In this exercise, you will find the names of cities that do not have the same names as their countries.

Instructions

Return all cities that do not have the same name as a country.  */
