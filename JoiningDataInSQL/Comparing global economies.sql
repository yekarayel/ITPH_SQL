/* Comparing global economies
Are you ready to perform your first set operation?

In this exercise, you have two tables, economies2015 and economies2019, available to you under the tabs in the console. You'll perform 
a set operation to stack all records in these two tables on top of each other, excluding duplicates.

When drafting queries containing set operations, it is often helpful to write the queries on either side of the operation first, 
and then call the set operator. The instructions are ordered accordingly.

Instructions

* Begin your query by selecting all fields from economies2015.
* Create a second query that selects all fields from economies2019.
* Perform a set operation to combine the two queries you just created, ensuring you do not return duplicates.  */
