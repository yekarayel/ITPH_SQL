/* Subquery challenge
You're near the finish line! Test your understanding of subquerying with a challenge problem.

Suppose you're interested in analyzing inflation and unemployment rate for certain countries in 2015. You are not interested in 
countries with "Republic" or "Monarchy" as their form of government, but are interested in all other forms of government, such as 
emirate federations, socialist states, and commonwealths.

You will use the field gov_form to filter for these two conditions, which represents a country's form of government. 
You can review the different entries for gov_form in the countries table.

Instructions

* Select country code, inflation_rate, and unemployment_rate from economies.
* Filter code for the set of countries which do not contain the words "Republic" or "Monarchy" in their gov_form.  */


-- Select relevant fields
SELECT code, inflation_rate, unemployment_rate
FROM economies
WHERE year = 2015 AND code NOT IN
-- Subquery returning country codes filtered on gov_form
    (SELECT code
    FROM countries
    WHERE gov_form LIKE '%Republic%' OR gov_form LIKE '%Monarchy%')
ORDER BY inflation_rate;
