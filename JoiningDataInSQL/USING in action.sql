/* USING in action
In the previous exercises, you performed your joins using the ON keyword. 
Recall that when both the field names being joined on are the same, you can take advantage of the USING clause.

You'll now explore the languages table from our database. Which languages are official languages, and which ones are unofficial?

You'll employ USING to simplify your query as you explore this question.

Instructions

* Use the country code field to complete the INNER JOIN with USING; do not change any alias names. */

SELECT c.name AS country, l.name AS language, official
FROM countries AS c
INNER JOIN languages AS l
-- Match using the code column
USING(code);
