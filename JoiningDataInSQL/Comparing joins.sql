/* Comparing joins
In this exercise, you'll examine how results can differ when performing a full join compared to a left join and inner join by joining 
the countries and currencies tables. You'll be focusing on the North American region and records where the name of the country is missing.

You'll begin with a full join with countries on the left and currencies on the right. 
Recall the workings of a full join with the diagram below! */

/* You'll then complete a similar left join and conclude with an inner join, observing the results you see along the way.  */
