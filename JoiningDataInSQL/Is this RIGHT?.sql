/* Is this RIGHT?
You learned that right joins are not used as commonly as left joins. A key reason for this is that right joins can always be re-written 
as left joins, and because joins are typically typed from left to right, joining from the left feels more intuitive when constructing queries.

It can be tricky to wrap one's head around when left and right joins return equivalent results. You'll explore this in this exercise! 


Instructions
